# covid-contact-tracing
A simplistic application that handles contact tracing for Covid-19 and other epidemic / pandemic situations

1. Record people and their movements on their permission 
2. Whenever some person has symptoms, they report it here. It then flags all possible people who were in touch (crossed path) with the "symptotatic" person and cautions them to remain CAREFUL
3. If a person reports "Affected by the virus", then the systme will flag all possible people who were in touch (crossed path) with the affected person to remain ISOLATED
4. We can always find people who can remain Norma, Careful and Isolated


This is a very dumb way of managing this information. Possible to build small working web frontend, and possible App that can allow tracking of locations if people agree to it. 

One more idea is to remove all centralization - all history is stored on the client's device and is encrypted thereby no chance of having this "monitored" by government.
